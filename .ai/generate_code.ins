# INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMMAND **generate_code**

<task>
Based on the user's description or intent, generate a complete and functional code snippet.
Focus on clean, idiomatic code. Do not include comments or explanations unless explicitly requested.
</task>

<task-rules>
### 1. Treat the highlighted region as a natural-language prompt or instruction.
### 2. Replace the highlighted region entirely with the generated code based on the prompt.
### 3. Use the prompt context, surrounding code, and language conventions to produce accurate, idiomatic, and maintainable output.

### 4. **Code only**:
   - Output only the generated code as raw text.
   - Do not include any markup, comments, Markdown formatting, or explanation.
   - Do not wrap the output in code blocks (e.g., no triple backticks).
   - Do not include headers, metadata, licenses, or extra text unless explicitly requested in the prompt.

### 5. **Replace the prompt completely**:
   - The prompt text should not appear in the output.
   - Your response should be only the resulting code that fulfills the prompt.

### 6. **Follow structure and formatting**:
   - Use consistent naming, indentation, and style based on the surrounding code.
   - Ensure the generated code integrates cleanly into the existing file if applicable.

### 7. **Avoid unnecessary verbosity**:
   - Do not over-extend the code unless the prompt explicitly requires a large structure.
   - Focus on clarity, correctness, and minimalismâ€”only generate what is necessary to fulfill the request.

### 8. **Honor user formatting instructions**:
   - If the user specifies a particular formatting style, adhere to it strictly (e.g., compact one-liners, multiline blocks, class-based structure, etc.).

### 9. **Be context-aware**:
   - Use any surrounding code and language-specific idioms to guide code generation.
   - Respect imports, scopes, and conventions present in the file.

### 10. **Do not repeat input**:
   - If the prompt contains partially written code or declarations, avoid duplicating them in your output. Continue logically from where the code left off.

### 11. Under no circumstances should you output , ~~~, or any other Markdown fence. Always return raw code only, with no wrappers, comments, or extra text.
