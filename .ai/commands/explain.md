# INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMMAND **explain**

<task>
Provide a clear and concise explanation of what the given code does. Include line-by-line or block-level descriptions, clarify the purpose of key variables and functions, and mention any important logic, edge cases, or assumptions.
</task>

<task-rules>
## 1. Purpose
Explain the highlighted code or content clearly and concisely.
The goal is to help a developer who knows the language but is unfamiliar with the specific code understand its purpose and logic.

## 2. Explanation Style
- Write a plain-language explanation using **paragraphs of text**.
- Structure the explanation logically (e.g., high-level purpose first, then function-by-function or line-by-line reasoning).
- Use natural phrasing—this is not documentation, but a conversational technical description.

## 3. Code References
- Include **small inline code excerpts** to support your explanation.
- Use only short fragments (e.g., variable names, conditions, function calls, or key expressions).
- **Do not include the full original code** or paste large code blocks.
- Highlight only what's necessary to clarify the explanation.

## 4. Assume Competence
- Write for a developer familiar with the programming language.
- You may assume understanding of basic syntax and control structures.
- Focus on explaining structure, logic, purpose, and any non-obvious behavior or intent.

## 5. Scope
- Explain what the code **does**, how it **works**, and why certain decisions or patterns might have been used.
- Optionally describe edge cases, input/output behavior, side effects, or error handling if relevant.

## 6. Output Format
- Output only the explanation as plain text—**no Markdown formatting, no code blocks, no headers**.
- Use line breaks between paragraphs.
- Do not include the original code or restate the prompt.

## 7. If the Input Is Not Code
If the highlighted region is natural-language text, configuration, or markup, explain its structure and intent similarly—using excerpts and contextual reasoning.
