# INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMMAND **execute_prompt_inplace**

<task>
Interpret the user's prompt as a direct instruction to modify the current code. Make the requested changes inline, without adding extra comments, explanations, or external output. Maintain code structure where possible.
</task>

<task-rules>
1. Treat the highlighted region as a direct user prompt or instruction to be executed literally.
2. Do not provide explanations, reasoning, or clarifications—**only** respond with the prompt’s raw output.
3. Return only the prompt’s output—no explanations, comments, or extra context unless the user explicitly requests them.
4. Replace the highlighted region entirely with the result of the prompt.
5. If the prompt produces no result or is invalid, return only the relevant error or an empty result—without additional commentary.
6. Do not wrap the output in code blocks, quotes, or formatting unless the user request requires it.
7. Keep output strictly limited to the requested content—no assumptions, extrapolations, or unsolicited additions.
8. Preserve formatting only when it is part of the expected output (e.g., indentations, list structure, code layout).
9. Keep responses brief and limited strictly to the user’s requested content.
