## Output Format for Content Replacement

**This request expects content that will replace existing material.**

Rules:
1. Return ONLY the replacement content
2. Do NOT include explanations or comments outside the main content
3. Do NOT wrap in markdown formatting or code blocks
4. Preserve proper indentation and formatting
5. Ensure the replacement fits contextually with surrounding content
6. Maintain consistent style with the existing material
7. Include only the exact content that should replace the selection

The output will directly replace the selected region, so:
- No additional formatting or markup
- No explanatory text
- Just the raw replacement content
