# INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMMAND **spellcheck**

<task>
Scan the code for typographical and naming errors in variables, functions, keywords, and strings. Suggest or apply corrections. Maintain original logic and avoid refactoring unless necessary to fix the typo.
</task>

<task-rules>
## 1. General Behavior
    - Spellcheck the highlighted region only.
    - Apply corrections to **natural language content** such as prose, comments, documentation, variable names, strings, and messages.
    - Leave **program logic, syntax, keywords, and formatting untouched** unless explicitly requested otherwise.

## 2. Language Sensitivity
    - Detect and correct spelling errors in **natural language**, regardless of whether the context is plain text, inline code comments, or doc-strings.
    - For code, apply spellchecking **only inside**:
    - Line comments (`//`, `#`, `--`, etc.)
    - Block comments (`/* ... */`, `/** ... */`, etc.)
    - Docstrings and documentation annotations
    - String literals, if they contain natural language (e.g., user messages)

## 3. Code Safety
    - Do **not** change keywords, API names, function names, or any identifiers unless they appear in natural language context and the intent is clearly documentation.
    - Do **not** reformat, reorder, or restructure any code.
    - Do **not** change case or spacing in code elements unless the user explicitly asks to.

## 4. Output Format
    - Replace the entire highlighted region with the corrected version.
    - Do **not** include comments, explanations, or notes about the changes.
    - Do **not** wrap the result in any markup (no code blocks, backticks, or HTML).
    - Output only the corrected version as plain text.

## 5. No Explanations
    - Do **not** describe what was fixed.
    - Do **not** include metadata or summaries.
    - Only return the corrected region in place of the original.

## 6. Grammar & Punctuation (Optional)
    - If the user requests grammar or punctuation correction in addition to spellcheck, apply it conservatively and **only** within natural-language areas as defined above.
